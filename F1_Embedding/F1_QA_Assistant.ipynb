      "The 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship was a motor racing championship for Formula One cars, which was the 73rd running of the Formula One World Championship. It is recognised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the governing body of international motorsport, as the highest class of competition for open-wheel racing cars. The championship was contested over twenty-two Grands Prix, which were held around the world, and ended earlier than in recent years to avoid overlapping with the FIFA World Cup.Drivers and teams competed for the titles of World Drivers' Champion and World Constructors' Champion, respectively. The 2022 championship saw the introduction of significant changes to the sport's technical regulations. These changes had been intended to be introduced in 2021, but were delayed until 2022 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Max Verstappen, who was the reigning Drivers' Champion, claimed his second title at the Japanese Grand Prix, while his team, Red Bull Racing, achieved their fifth World Constructor Championship, and first since 2013, at the following United States Grand Prix. Mercedes were the reigning Constructors' Champion.This was the final season for four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel. Seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton endured a difficult season with Mercedes, failing to secure either a pole position or Grand Prix win during the season, the first time either occurrence had happened in his Formula One career since it began in 2007.\n",

Championship leader, Max Verstappen finished seventh after acquiring car damage early in the race. A multi-car crash occurred on the opening lap, in which Zhou Guanyu's car flipped over the tyre wall marking the circuit boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\nPath: 2022 British Grand Prix - Background\\nBody:\\n2022 British Grand Prix: Background ==\\nThe event was held across the weekend of the 1–3 July. It was the tenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship. It was the 73rd time the British Grand Prix has been held and the race took place two weeks after the Canadian Grand Prix and preceded the Austrian Grand Prix.\\n\\n\\n=== Championship standings before the race ===\\nFollowing the Canadian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen led the Drivers' Championship by 46 points from teammate Sergio Pérez, with Charles Leclerc third, a further three points behind. Red Bull Racing led the Constructors' Championship, leading Ferrari by 74 points. Mercedes were in third place, trailing Ferrari by 40 points.\\n\\n\\n=== Entrants ===\\n\\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race. It was the 150th race start for Carlos Sainz Jr.\\n\\n\\n=== Tyre choices ===\\n\\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C1, C2, and C3 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.\\n\\n\\n\\nPath: 2022 British Grand Prix - Qualifying\\nBody:\\n2022 British Grand Prix: Qualifying ==\\nQualifying started at 15:00 local time on 2 July, and lasted for one hour. The session was held in wet conditions and ended with Carlos Sainz Jr. claiming his maiden pole position. Max Verstappen's final qualifying attempt was interrupted by yellow flags, after Charles Leclerc spun.\\n\\n\\n=== Qualifying classification ===\\n\\n\\n\\nPath: 2022 British Grand Prix - Championship standings after the race\\nBody:\\n2022 British Grand Prix: Championship standings after the race ==\\n\\nNote: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings.\\n\\n\\n\\nPath: 2022 British Grand Prix - Race - Race report - 2022 British Grand Prix - Race - Race report\\nBody:\\nRace report ===\\nThe race started at 15:00 local time on 3 July. Max Verstappen took the lead at the start from Carlos Sainz Jr., while Lewis Hamilton moved up to third. George Russell had a bad start and was passed by Nicholas Latifi and Zhou Guanyu pulled alongside him leaving a large gap between them. Gasly attempted to pass between Zhou and Russell, but Russell moved to the left too late to close the gap causing his left rear tyre to make contact with Gasly's right front. Gasly backed out but the impact pointed Russell's car to the left shooting him across the track and directly into the side of Zhou's car. The impact launched Zhou's car into the air. He landed upside down, skidding down the track, then skipping and bouncing across the long gravel trap at the end of the straightaway, all while barely slowing and turning sideways. The inverted car suddenly dug into the gravel carrying sufficient speed and momentum to launch it over the tire barrier, rotating 540 degrees on its axis before hitting the catch fencing sideways facing up just a few feet from the front row of the grandstand. It then dropped 8 feet and landed wedged into the small gap between the fence and tire barrier, stopping on its side with the cockpit up against the backside of the tire barrier. As a result of the incident, Valtteri Bottas slowed slightly, which caused Alexander Albon to also slow. Sebastian Vettel attempted to brake, but was too close to Albon and hit him. Albon spun into the concrete pit wall, rebounded back on the track and was hit by Yuki Tsunoda and Esteban Ocon, damaging both of their cars. Tsunoda and Ocon both returned to the pit lane for repairs, but Albon was unable to continue. Russell, who had spun, stopped to help the marshalls with Zhou's flipped car. When he returned to his car it was not running so he could not continue. Race control red-flagged the race due to both crashes. Zhou was extracted from his Alfa Romeo and stretchered to an ambulance where he was taken to the race medical centre. Albon was also taken to the race medical centre but was later transferred by helicopter to Coventry Hospital for observations. Both were later released.The order for the race restart was set to the grid order, as not all the cars had passed the second safety car line before the race was red-flagged, meaning it was not possible to accurately determine the running order at the time of the red flag. The race restarted at 15:56 local time and Sainz retained the lead at the restart, before being passed by Verstappen once DRS was enabled. Verstappen later ran over debris, that resulted in a loss of pace. Verstappen misjudged that the loss of pace was a puncture and came into the pit for new tyres. Red Bull later realised it was floor damage that caused the pace loss.The two AlphaTauri cars collided on lap 14, both continued initially but Gasly later retired due to the collision damage.Bottas pitted and retired on lap 20 due to a gearbox issue and on lap 39, Ocon suffered a fuel pump problem and stopped on track, causing a safety car. The safety car allowed everyone to pit. Charles Leclerc was one of a few drivers not to pit, being told to stay out by his Ferrari team. Leclerc led the restart but was quickly passed by teammate Sainz. Leclerc subsequently defended from Sergio Pérez, which allowed Hamilton to pass them both on the exit of the last corner. Once Pérez passed Leclerc, he re-overtook Hamilton for second. \\n\\nSainz won his first Formula One race, becoming the 112th winner in the history of the championship, the second Spaniard to win a Formula One race after Fernando Alonso, and being the first Spaniard to win a race since the 2013 Spanish Grand Prix. and the first driver who had his maiden win at the British Grand Prix since Johnny Herbert in 1995. Pérez was in second and Hamilton third, also setting the fastest lap. Leclerc managed to stay ahead of Alonso for fourth, as the latter finished fifth, ahead of Lando Norris. Despite a last lap battle, Verstappen held off Mick Schumacher for seventh. Schumacher finished inside the points for the first time in his Formula One career. Sebastian Vettel was ninth and Kevin Magnussen was tenth.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease answer the following question: Who came in 2nd at the British Grand Prix in 2022\"}]\n"
